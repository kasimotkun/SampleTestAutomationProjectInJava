Sample Test Automation Project With Selenium And TestNG In Java
Hi,

I developed this project with Java, TestNG and Selenium 

#Tips:
- Logging

- Readable report

- Failure evidences
 
- generating random values for insignificant test data, for example, for new user

- Configurable for env/browsers/urls
  
- Support for parallel execution
 

- Reading test data from file, for example, the name of dress, size and color in the
checkout test.
 

#How To Run

Please install at least Java 1.8 and open command prompt inside the project folder, and then prompt 
"java -Dtestng.dtd.http=true -cp "".\bin;.\selenium-3.141.59\*;.\selenium-3.141.59\*;.\selenium-3.141.59\libs\*;.\testng_7.2.0\*"" org.testng.TestNG testng.xml"   in the comment line.
